# Tracking-Climate-Change-with-Machine-Learning-and-Time-Series
The ocean absorbs a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, which contributes to rising ocean temperatures. Increasing ocean temperatures affect marine species and ecosystems, often resulting in events such as coral bleaching. Additionally, warmer ocean temperatures can contribute to more extreme weather events.
Tracking Climate Change and Sea Surface Temperatures with Time Series and Machine Learning

This project aims to predict and understand the changes in Sea Surface Temperature. This README file overviews the project structure and details the naming conventions used for Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau Workbooks, and other files.

Directory Structure:

- Notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks for each step of the project.
  - NOAA Time Series.ipynb: Notebook for data exploration, visualization, and time series modeling          
   (SARIMA modeling)
  - CalCOFI.ipynb: Notebook for cleaning, preprocessing, and preparing the dataset for model     
    training.

- Environments: Contains all the environments that were used for this capstone project
  - Time Series Environment
  - Base Environment

- Report: Is the final and summarized report of my findings
